## Setup:
![Desktop](barra.png)
**EndeavourOs i3** is the base of my setup (or just install i3-blocks, and feh)
* Make all files on i3/scripts folder executable (chmod +x)
* To make wallpaper button work: move wallpaper folder to **~/.config/**
* **I created a timer** (for i3blocks): use scroll weel to change => left click to start => left to stop
* Install [FiraCode Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads)
* gtk theme [Catppuccin](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/catppuccin-gtk-theme-mocha)
* [icons](https://github.com/ljmill/catppuccin-icons)
* use Thunar for file ; floorp for web.
